# Things I might do but mainly offloaded from my brain

- sensible ENV configs (address and netmask)
- secure DB tRPC from non-localhost queries
- authentication and authorization
- use client id instead of mac as primary key
- handle DHCPINFORM
- handle DHCPRELEASE
- define IP from app?
- add Zod typings to DB level
- support other MAC formats than just ':'-separated
- broadcast DHCP replies to any and all interfaces, instead of asking for a specific NIC?
- responsive design (for mobile phone)
- support handling aliases for macs that aren't in the logs (adding and/or removing)
- add mDNS for easy access to aliased computers
- either fix the "report db errors into db" bug, or remove it completely
- option to clean up log after some time
- assign reserved ips for clients (outside and inside the DHCP range)
- download "all" configs as json (at least aliases + reserved ips)
- disable `@neat-dhpcd/litel` by default, and enable with some simple trick (env var?)
- don't crash if client can't connect to `@neat-dhpcd/litel` server
- remove unnecessary `system` param from remote tracking
- make a functional wrapper for `@neat-dhpcd/litel` to avoid try/catch
- make an even more automated version of `buildRelease.sh` - less manual steps after building
- enable reserving IPs for (and aliasing) clients that haven't been seen yet
- validate MAC strings
